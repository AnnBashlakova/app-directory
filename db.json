      "description": "Capybaras are large, semi-aquatic rodents native to South America. They are the largest rodents in the world, with adults typically weighing between 35 and 66 kg (77-146 pounds) and measuring around 1.3 meters (4.3 feet) in length. Capybaras are well adapted to living near water, and are often found in or near rivers, lakes, and swamps. They have webbed feet and can hold their breath underwater for up to five minutes, which helps them escape from predators like jaguars and anacondas.",
